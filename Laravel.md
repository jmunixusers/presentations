# Laravel with Homestead : Web app Development and Management

[PHP Docs](http://php.net/manual/en/)

[Laravel Docs](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5)


## What is Homestead

- Homestead is a pre-packaged vagrant box that provides you will all the development tools that you need by default

- Once you have setup your virtual machine and vagrant, you simply add homestead box to it and all of the development tools are installed automatically for you. This saves you the time of individually installing the required software.

- Laravel homestead isn’t limited to the Laravel framework.

- You can generally development any PHP web application using homestead.


## Advantages of Homestead

- Local development environment simulates production environment

- Needed software out of the box

- VM’s can be disposable and recreated within minutes without affecting application source code

- Easily share your vagrantfile with others


## Introduction to PHP and Laravel

- PHP, very much like node.js or ruby is a back-end language. It is especially suited for web development.

- Laravel is a front-end framework for PHP. 

- Writing PHP and Laravel feels very similar to writing Ruby and Rails respectively. 


An example of this can be seen here when we make controllers for websites:


### Rails
```
class ForumsController < ApplicationController

  def index
    @forums = Forum.all
  end

end
```

### Laravel
```
<?php

class FarmController extends Controller{
  public function index(){
    $farms = Farm::all();
    return view('farms.index', ['farms' => $farms]);
  }
}

?>
```

## How to Setup and Install

- First we need to install virtual box and vagrant:
    - [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
    - [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

- Once these two are installed type the following in your terminal:

```
vagrant box add laravel/homestead
```

- You will need to make a choice of what provider you want, enter 2 for virtualbox:

![provider](./images/laravel/provider-choice.png)


- Next type into your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/laravel/homestead.git Homestead
```

- To Initialize our homestead we need to cd into the homestead directory and type:

```
bash init.sh
```

- Create an ssh key if it doesn’t exist: 

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C “your_email@example.com”
```

- Open the homestead directory in your preferred text editor, change homestead.yaml to the following::

![homestead.yaml](./images/laravel/HomesteadYaml.png) 

- In the terminal type:
``` 
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

  - At the end of the file add the following:
```
192.168.10.10 homestead.app
```
  - Press ctrl + X followed by Y and then enter to save your changes.


## Vagrant Global Aliases

```
# Some shortcuts for easier navigation & access
alias ..="cd ..";
alias vm="ssh vagrant@127.0.0.1 -p 2222";

# Homestead shortcut
function homestead() {
  ( cd ~/Homestead && vagrant $* )
} 
```

  - To up vagrant box use: homestead up

  - To stop vagrant box use: homestead halt

  - To log into vagrant box use: homestead ssh


## Creating Your First Project

- Homestead ssh

- Cd to shared folder ~/Code

- composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel Laravel

- Creates a default project in a directory called Laravel inside of the code folder

- Laravel uses a MVC architecture

- To view the created app load homestead.app in the browser, which has been linked to ```192.168.10.10``` in the host file


## Laravel File Structure
