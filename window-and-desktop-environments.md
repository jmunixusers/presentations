# WM/DEs
*By Michael McGloin*
## Introduction
Coming from Windows/OSX, the idea of being able to change the default system
user interface can be a strange one. Both systems go to great lengths to make
their user experience acceptable for all users, but because of this it lacks
in some things that power users might want.

Linux, on the other hand, allows users to not only choose what type of
environment they want, but allows them to customize and even create their own
environments altogether, if they have the know-how. These evironments are
made up of **window managers** and **desktop environments**.

## The Basics
### Window Managers
Window managers (WM) are (generally) X-based clients that control the appearance
and behavior of frames (windows) where various graphical applications are drawn.
The manager determines the border, titlebar, size, and ability to resize
windows. Many window mangers are bundled with simple utilities like menus to
start applications or configure the WM itself.

For this presentation, we will talk about window managers as standalone, even
though all desktop environments include a window manager, just for ease of
distinction. Many window managers are not bundled with a desktop environment and
give the user complete freedom over teh choice of other applications to be used.
This allows the user to create a more customized environment, tailored to their
own specific needs. When using a standalone window manager, 'extras' like
desktop icons, toolbars, wallpapers, or widgets must be added with additional
dedicated applications.

The benefits of using a window manager and seperate applications to add what you
need are obviously that you get a more streamlined and customized experience,
where you can add what you want and ignore what you dont, while also providing
more customizability to your setup. The downside is everything is left up to
you. Nothing comes set up  or is even garenteed to work out of the box on your
machine. Configuration is also generally through the use of config files that
can be scattered throughout the system and have all sorts of different syntax.

### Desktop Environments
A desktop environment (DE) bundles together a variety of components to provide
a common graphical user interface that includes all the usual trappings of a
regular user expeirence. These generally include a window manager, desktop
background, icons, toolbar, and perhaps even desktop widgets. 

From here, the user is free to customize their GUI environment in many ways.
Desktop environments generally provide nicer and more easy to use configurations
for their apps, as they will generally be more integrated into graphical
elements instead of configuration files and the like.

The benefits to Destkop environments are that they have a much more unified
interface and generally work right after install, or take very few steps to get
to a working state. Many times, parts of destkop environments can be swapped
out, such as window managers or toolbars. The downsides are that a full desktop
environment is normally a heavier load on the system, as well as not being
as streamlined for each individual user's needs.
